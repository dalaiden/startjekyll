I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Earth and Life Institute, UCLouvain, Belgium.

My main research topic focuses on the understanding of the historical climate changes, with particular attention to the Antarctic region. For doing so, my research relies on various sources of information, from paleoclimate records (e.g., ice cores, tree rings, corals, etc) to climate model simulations. I combine them using a data assimilation method that makes use of the maximum potential of observations and the physics of the climate to provide a complete reconstruction of the climate state over the present and past.

Actually, I am particularly interested in understanding the drivers of the past changes in the mass balance of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, which represents one of the main threats to the future global sea-level rise.

Previously, I worked on Arctic sea-ice changes through driftwood supply records along the Arctic coasts and obtained a PhD in Climatology by working on the Antarctic hydroclimate over the past centuries at UCLouvain.

In my free time, I love practising outdoor endurance activities (cycling, triathlon, running, mountain hiking) including long-distance international competitions with a national title in triathlon.
